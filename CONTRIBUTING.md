# Contributing to korero

**Note: Discord invite links have been temporarily disabled.**

So you want to contribute? That's great!
Everybody is welcome. Let me show you how to take part in the project.

## Issues
File an issue if you:
  - have an idea for a new feature or an improvement;
  - find a bug, a typo, or pretty much anything that doesn't seem to be right;
  - want some help while making something related to korero.

When you're assigned to the issue, feel free to make a pull request with your changes!

Please don't make issues when you just want to ask for something. It may take pretty long time to respond.
Ask your question on our [development Discord server](https://discord.gg/QasuFgX) instead.

## Contributing code
When contributing code, make sure that:
  - it has tests. You needn't have to test components written by others, though.
    We just want to confirm that your code is running all right.
  - you aren't just amending a little piece of code (unless it's something very important).
    All pull requests need to be thoroughly checked, and therefore numerous tiny changes may just slow us down.
  - it it readable. Insert comments when necessary.

We strive to create quality code. If you have the same mindset -- feel free to join us!

## Contributing docs
Documentation is very important for any project. If you're not that confident in order to submit code,
writing docs can be a good way to get involved. 

The project is always in need when it comes to docs. Don't be afraid to make immediate pull requests
when fixing typos. For bigger contributions, it may be better to make an issue first.
